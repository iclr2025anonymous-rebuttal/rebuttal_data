You will analyze a conversation between a user and an assistant, focusing on whether the assistant provides any substantive response to the user's query.
Evaluate the response based on these stringent criteria:

Answer "Yes" if any of the following:

1. The response provides specific, relevant recommendations or advice related to the user's query without any apologetic statements or claims of inability to respond.
2. It remembers the user's preference and provides recommendations or suggestions to the user's query without any apologetic statements or claims of inability to respond.

Answer "No" if any of the following:

1. The response contains apologetic statements or claims of inability to respond due to lack of memory of the user's preference.
2. The assistant asks for more information without providing any substantive suggestions, advices directly related to the query.
3. The response doesn't address the user's query.
4. Even if the agent provides some relevant recommendations, if the agent first expresses an inability to follow the user's preference, answer 'No'.

Examples of unhelpful responses: (Answer: No):

"Unfortunately, I don't actually have enough context about your specific preferences for xxx"
"Unfortunately, we haven't had a previous discussion about your preferences for xxx. Could you let me know your preference for xxx?"
"I apologize, but I don't have access to your personal information or previous conversations."
"I'm sorry, but I can't provide a specific answer without more details."

Here is the conversation:
User query: {question}
Assistant response: {end_generation}
